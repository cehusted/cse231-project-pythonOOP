# cse231-project-pythonOOP

**CSE 231 - Object Oriented Programming II** was a course taught in Java. As an exercise, and in my attempt to improve my skills with Python, I decided to attempt to translate my final project from Java over to __Python 2.7__.
###### _See "cse231-project-javaOOP" repository for original version of this project_

## Creating a Pythonic adaption of this project helped me:

* Learn how to do OOP in PYthon
* Learn how to work with data structures in Python (including debugging!)
* Learn how to work with global variables in Python
* Find a bug in my original Java code
* Learn how to raise exceptions for bad input
* Learn how to manipulate .csv files in Python
* Get more practice with __init__ and other special functions
* Realize that Java and Python use different algorithms as their default "hash" functions!
